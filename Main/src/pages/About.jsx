                        Hello, I'm Lily Yang an aspiring Full Stack Developer.
                        I'm currently trying to break into tech as a software engineer.
                        I became interested in coding after taking a few classes in college.
                        On top of my degree in physics, I have attended a University of Minnesota
                        bootcamp and have learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Postgres SQL, Monogoose, React, and MERN.
                    </p>
