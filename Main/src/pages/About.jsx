        <p>
            Hello, I'm Lily Yang an aspiring Full Stack Developer.
            I'm currently trying to break into tech as a software engineer.
            I became interested in coding after taking a few classes in college.
            On top of my degree in physics, I have attended a University of Minnesota
            bootcamp and have learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Postgres SQL, Monogoose, React, and MERN.
