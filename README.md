# React Portfolio

## Description 
This react portfolio was used to create a professional portfolio using React to showcase an indivdual's qualifications. By creating this project I was able understand how to use components, pages and styling within React. The premise of this project was to gain a better understand of how React works and be able to have a portfolio which can be used in the future in the case of applying to jobs within the tech field. This portfolio contains a header and footer to navigate to the different pages within this project. A side note is that this portfolio is not completed and with be edited in the future.
